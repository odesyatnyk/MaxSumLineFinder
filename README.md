# Task

The task of finding a row with the maximum sum of elements.  

A file is provided (the path to the file must either be requested from the user when starting the program, or taken from the command line parameters, if specified).
Each line contains a set of numbers (separated by commas, point - decimal separator).
 - Print the line number with the maximum total sum of elements.
 - The line numbers in which non-numeric elements ("defective lines") are encountered should be displayed in a separate list.

## Usage

Navigate to the root of the `exe` file and open `cmd`
Type name of the executable and provide path  to the file as first and single argument.
If path will not be provided - you will be prompted to enter it.
